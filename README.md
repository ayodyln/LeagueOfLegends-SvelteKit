# SvelteKit // League of Legends

#### Live Demo [svelte-league.dylan-portfolio.dev/](svelte-league.dylan-portfolio.dev/)

This project is meant to demonstrate my comprehension of the SvelteKit framework and its tools. Pairing the framework with the Riot League of Legends API(s), for my app's theme and content. The purpose of the app is to create a way to create builds for Leage of Legends Champions, with help of Riot's API. SvelteKit has the ability to save data as a `Store`, which is essentially data stored in your local session. That was my main goal to understand for this project, and how to work with Svelte Stores.
